# Burnout Prevention System

## Overview

This script implements a Burnout Prevention System for software developers. It uses machine learning to predict optimal working conditions and provides recommendations to prevent burnout.

## Classes

### Developer

Represents a software developer.

#### Attributes:
- `name`: Developer's name
- `role`: Developer's role
- `tasks`: List of assigned tasks
- `hours_worked`: Dictionary of worked hours per date
- `burnout_rate`: Dictionary of burnout rates per date
- `ai_assistance_enabled`: Boolean for AI assistance status

### BurnoutPreventionSystem

Manages burnout prevention for multiple developers.

#### Key Methods:
- `add_developer(developer)`: Add a new developer to the system
- `log_work(developer, date, hours, burnout_rate)`: Log work for a developer
- `train_models(developer)`: Train ML models for a developer
- `get_recommendations(developer)`: Generate recommendations for a developer
- `monitor_burnout()`: Monitor burnout for all developers
- `suggest_tasks(developer, date)`: Suggest tasks based on optimal conditions
- `toggle_ai_assistance(developer)`: Toggle AI assistance for a developer
- `use_ai_assistance(developer, task)`: Use AI to generate code for a task

## Machine Learning Models

- Uses Random Forest Regressors to predict optimal working hours and workload
- Features include average weekly hours, burnout rates, and task counts

## Usage

1. Create a `BurnoutPreventionSystem` instance
2. Add developers using `add_developer()`
3. Log work data using `log_work()`
4. Add tasks to developers
5. Use `monitor_burnout()` to get recommendations
6. Optionally use AI assistance features

## Example

```python
bps = BurnoutPreventionSystem()
dev = Developer("John Doe", "Software Engineer")
bps.add_developer(dev)
# Log work and add tasks
bps.monitor_burnout()
```

## Dependencies

- datetime
- typing
- numpy
- scikit-learn

Note: OpenAI integration is commented out and would require additional setup.
